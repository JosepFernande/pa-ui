# CI/CD Pipeline

## Purpose

Defines the CI/CD pipeline for `pa-ui`: the jobs, the checks, the triggers, the
artifacts, the release flow, and the branch protection rules. This is the
contract for how code moves from a PR to a published package.

Complement this with
[Contribution & PR Guidelines](./contribution-pr-code-review-guidelines.md) (the
PR process), [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md) (which tests run), and
[Release and Publishing](./release-and-publishing.md) (the release workflow
itself). Everything below was verified line-by-line against the real workflow
files in `.github/workflows/` and against the live repo configuration (branch
protection, secrets, labels, merge settings) — there is no local equivalent of
this page prior to this migration, so precision matters more here than
elsewhere.

## Provider and Infrastructure

| Item            | Choice                                                 | Rationale                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI provider     | **GitHub Actions**                                     | The repo is on GitHub; no third-party CI needed for v1.                |
| Runners         | `ubuntu-latest`                                        | Linux ships Chrome preinstalled in case a future visual test needs it. |
| Cache           | **Local Nx cache** (`.nx/cache` restored between jobs) | Nx Cloud is deferred (see Nx workspace setup).                         |
| Package manager | **npm**                                                | Per the project's versioning conventions.                              |
| Node version    | **pinned via `.nvmrc`**                                | Angular 19 + Nx 20 require Node 18.19+; the repo pins a newer LTS.     |

## Workflow Overview

There are four workflows in `.github/workflows/` (verified via
`gh workflow list`: `CI`, `Release`, `Smoke`, `Storybook Build` — all `active`):

1. **`ci.yml`** — runs only on `pull_request` (not on push to `main`). Lint,
   stylelint, test, build, audit, gga-review. Must pass before merge (see branch
   protection below).
2. **`release.yml`** — runs on every push to `main` that touches `libs/**`,
   `.changeset/**`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, or the workflow file
   itself. With pending changesets, it opens a **Release PR** with the version
   bumps (does not commit to `main` directly); once that PR is merged (no
   pending changesets left), it validates and publishes to npm, creates a git
   tag, and cuts a GitHub Release.
3. **`smoke.yml`** — runs on every push to `main`. Build-only, lightweight:
   branch protection already requires the branch to be up to date with `main`
   before merging, so re-running lint/test/audit would be pure duplication; this
   job only catches environment failures (registry down, rotated secret, runner
   drift) independent of the code.
4. **`storybook-build.yml`** — runs on PRs touching `.storybook/**`,
   `libs/button/**`, `libs/core/**`, or story files. Uploads the static
   Storybook build as an artifact. Not a required check.

## `ci.yml` (PR checks)

**Trigger:** `pull_request` only — does not run on push to `main` (that's
`smoke.yml`'s job).

**Concurrency:** cancels in-progress runs for the same ref.

`test` and `build` run with `nx run-many` (every project), not `nx affected`.
CSS linting is a separate job (`stylelint`), not a step inside `lint`. `audit`
runs two scripts (`tools/audit/index.ts` and `tools/audit/bundle-check.ts`) with
`tsx`.

`test` runs with `--coverage`, and the `coverageThreshold` (80% lines, 80%
branches, 90% functions, 80% statements) is centralized in `jest.preset.cjs` —
libs inherit it without duplicating it. If a lib falls below threshold, Jest
fails the `test` job (a real gate, not just a report).

Every job (`lint`, `stylelint`, `test`, `build`, `gga-review`) independently
runs its own `actions/checkout@v4` + `actions/setup-node@v4` (Node version from
`.nvmrc`, npm cache) + `npm ci` (`HUSKY=0`) + Nx cache restore — the `setup`
job's `needs: setup` dependency only orders the workflow, it does not share
filesystem state across jobs (each runs on its own runner).

                "${{ needs.build.result }}" != "success" || \
                "${{ needs.audit.result }}" != "success" ]]; then
            echo "One or more required jobs failed."
            exit 1
          fi
```

(Abridged for readability — every job repeats the full
checkout/setup-node/npm-ci/cache-restore preamble shown once in "Provider and
Infrastructure" above; see the real `ci.yml` for the literal steps.)

**Required status checks** (verified via
`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection`): `audit`, `build`, `lint`,
`test`, `gga-review`, `stylelint`. `gga-review` is listed as required, but its
job has `continue-on-error: true` — the inner step can fail without failing the
job, so in practice it never blocks the merge (a real soft-fail, even though it
is formally marked "required").

## `release.yml` (main only)

**Trigger:** push to `main`, filtered by `paths` (`libs/**`, `.changeset/**`,
`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`) — a
docs-only merge does not trigger this workflow.

**Timeout:** `timeout-minutes: 30` at the job level — covers the worst case
without blocking the `release-main` concurrency group for hours if an
`npm ci`/publish hangs.

**Real behavior — Release PR pattern, not a direct push:**

- If there are pending changesets: build, then `npx changeset version`, and
  instead of committing to `main` directly it opens a **Release PR**
  (`peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7`, branch `release/version-packages`) with
  the version bumps and CHANGELOGs. Publish does **not** happen in this same
  run.
- The "Check for changesets" gate is a custom script, not `changeset status`. It
  compares the existing `.md` files against `.changeset/pre.json`'s `changesets`
  array only when `pre.json` exists and its `mode` is `"pre"`; if `pre.json`
  doesn't exist (the repo's real state today — see
  [Release and Publishing](./release-and-publishing.md)) or its `mode` is
  `"exit"`, any pending `.md` file counts as pending unconditionally.
- When the Release PR is merged (no changesets left pending): runs
  `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=critical` as a **non-blocking** step
  (`continue-on-error: true`) and uploads the JSON report as an artifact instead
  of failing the job; runs `npm run validate:packages` as a **blocking** step
  (fails the release if any package's `dist/` `package.json` lost its
  `main`/`exports["."]`/`typings` entry point, or if the workflow stopped
  publishing from `dist/<lib>`); publishes each package directly from
  `dist/libs/<lib>` (not via `changeset publish`); and, if it actually published
  something new, creates a `release-v<version>` tag and a GitHub Release named
  after that real version.

See [Release and Publishing](./release-and-publishing.md) for the full publish
loop, the prerelease/`alpha` dist-tag logic, and the historical bugs this
workflow's shape was built to avoid.

## `smoke.yml` (post-merge, push to `main`)

**Trigger:** `push` to `main`.

Single `build` job, no lint/test/audit — branch protection with `strict: true`
already requires the branch to be up to date with `main` before merging, so the
commit landing on `main` was already validated in that exact state by the PR's
CI. This job only covers what the PR can't: environment failures (npm registry
down, rotated secret, runner drift).

## `storybook-build.yml` (PR preview)

**Trigger:** PRs touching `apps/showcase/.storybook/**`, `apps/showcase/**`,
`libs/*/src/lib/**/*.stories.ts`, `libs/button/**`, or `libs/core/**`. Uploads
the static Storybook build as an artifact — does not deploy publicly. Not a
required status check in branch protection.

See [Storybook](./storybook.md) for the Storybook configuration itself
(centralized in `apps/showcase/.storybook/`).

## Required Secrets

Configured in GitHub repo settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. Verified
via `gh secret list` — exactly two configured secrets exist today:

| Secret             | Used by                     | Required for                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `NPM_TOKEN`        | `release.yml`               | Publishing to npm                    |
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY` | `ci.yml` (`gga-review` job) | Model inference for the AI PR review |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub on every workflow run — it is
not a configured repo secret. No `GH_TOKEN` or Nx Cloud secrets are required
(remote caching remains unused; only local caching is configured).

## Branch Protection (`main`)

Configured in GitHub repo settings → Branches → Branch protection rules.
Verified live via `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection`:

- **Require a pull request before merging:** ON
- **Required approving reviews:** 0 (single-maintainer project for now; raise to
  1+ as the team grows)
- **Dismiss stale PR approvals on new commits:** ON
- **Require status checks to pass:** ON — required contexts: `audit`, `build`,
  `lint`, `test`, `gga-review`, `stylelint`; `strict: true` (branch must be up
  to date with `main`)
- **Require conversation resolution before merging:** ON
- **Require signed commits:** OFF (deferred; enable as the team grows)
- **Require linear history:** OFF
- **Include administrators:** ON (no bypass, not even for admins)
- **Allow force pushes:** OFF
- **Allow deletions:** OFF

Repo merge settings (`gh api repos/:owner/:repo`) allow all three merge
strategies — squash, merge commit, and rebase — no single strategy is enforced;
the real history mixes all three.

## Local Pre-Commit Hooks (husky)

**`pre-commit`** — runs on every `git commit`, using `gga` + `lint-staged`:

```bash
# ======== GGA START ========
if command -v gga >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  gga run || exit 1
fi
# ======== GGA END ========

npx lint-staged
```

`lint-staged` (config in `.lintstagedrc`) applies, only to staged files:

- `*.ts` → `eslint --fix`
- `libs/**/*.css` → `stylelint`
- everything else (except `.claude/**`) → `prettier --write --ignore-unknown`

**`commit-msg`** — runs on every `git commit` to enforce Conventional Commits:

```bash
npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"
```

**`pre-push`** — runs on every `git push`, against `origin/main`:

```bash
npx nx affected -t build --base=origin/main
```

## Failure Handling

| Failure                   | Action                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI red on a PR            | The author fixes the failure and pushes a new commit; CI re-runs automatically.                                             |
| Flaky test                | Use GitHub's "Re-run jobs" on the failed job. No special configuration.                                                     |
| Coverage below threshold  | Add tests until the threshold is met, or (rarely) the team agrees to lower it with documented justification.                |
| Build fails on `main`     | Revert the responsible commit immediately with `git revert`. Investigate offline.                                           |
| Release fails mid-publish | The publish loop skips versions already on npm, so re-running the workflow continues where it left off.                     |
| Secret leak               | Rotate the secret immediately. Audit npm for any package published from the leak. Add the secret to GitHub push protection. |

## Environment Notes

CI runs on GitHub-hosted Linux runners with Chrome preinstalled — different from
local development, which has its own constraints:

- **Local and CI:** Jest with jsdom (`jest-preset-angular`'s default) is the
  only test runner — there's no Karma configuration in the repo, so no Chrome
  dependency to run tests locally.
- **Visual regression testing** (Chromatic, Percy, or similar) is deferred. When
  introduced, it will run only in CI, not locally.

## AI Code Review (active — v1)

**Tool:**
[Gentleman Guardian Angel (gga)](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentleman-guardian-angel)
— provider-agnostic AI code review.

**Real provider:** `opencode:opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` (configured in
`.gga`) — **not** GitHub Models/`gpt-4o-mini`. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is only used to
post the verdict comment on the PR (`gh pr comment`), not for model inference.

**Where it runs:**

1. **Pre-commit hook** (local, active) — `.husky/pre-commit` runs `gga run` if
   the binary is installed.
2. **CI PR-mode** (`ci.yml`, `gga-review` job, `continue-on-error: true`) —
   reviews the full PR diff. Listed as a required status check in branch
   protection, but since it's soft-fail it never actually blocks a merge today.
3. **Automatic PR comment** — the job always posts the verdict (✅ APROBADO / ❌
   RECHAZADO, rule-to-evidence table in Spanish), with a fallback to "⚪ NO
   APLICA" (no files matching `FILE_PATTERNS`) or "❌ FALLÓ" (crash/timeout with
   no verdict) — the PR is never left without a comment.

**Rule source:** `AGENTS.md` is an **index** pointing to skills
(`pa-ui-architecture`, `pa-ui-coding-standards`, `pa-ui-testing`,
`github-issues-from-docs`), it does not contain the rules inline. `gga` does a
literal `cat` of `AGENTS.md` (it does not follow links); it's the agentic
provider (`opencode`, with `skill`/`glob`/`Read` tools) that resolves those
names at runtime.

**The real CI job** is more elaborate than a standard install — it clones
`gentleman-guardian-angel` into `/tmp/gga` and rewrites its
`parse_review_status()` function entirely to scan the **whole** model output and
keep the **last** `STATUS:` match (falls back to `AMBIGUOUS` if both PASSED and
FAILED appear), instead of the upstream fixed-line-window approach. It also
patches `lib/pr_mode.sh` to inject a mandatory Spanish response template. Uses
the `OPENCODE_API_KEY` secret for model inference.

**Cost control:**

- Runs only on PRs (not on every push)
- Free-tier model via OpenCode (not GitHub Models)
- gga's caching skips files unchanged between PR updates
- Estimated cost: **$0/month** (free-tier model)

## Future Improvements (v2+)

- **Dependabot** — automated dependency PRs
- **Signed commits** — enable in branch protection as the team grows
- **Auto-label PRs** — GitHub Actions labeling by scope (`area:button`,
  `area:theme`, etc.)
- **Performance budgets in CI** — fail if bundle size exceeds thresholds
- **Visual regression** — Storybook Chromatic or similar
- **Slack/Linear notifications** — on CI failure or release published

## Rules of the Team (enforced by CI)

- No PR merges without green CI.
- Coverage thresholds (80/80/90/80) are enforced via the centralized
  `coverageThreshold` in `jest.preset.cjs` plus `--coverage` in the `test` job —
  a run below threshold fails CI.
- Any change to `.github/workflows/**` requires a second reviewer (CI is
  critical infrastructure).
- Any change to `tools/audit/**` (the custom audit script) requires a second
  reviewer.
- Skipping CI (e.g. `[skip ci]` in commit messages) is **forbidden** for any
  commit touching `apps/**`, `libs/**`, or `tools/**`. The only exception is
  `[skip ci]` for a CHANGELOG-only or docs-only change.
